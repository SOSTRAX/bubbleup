# BubbleUp

**BubbleUp** is a lightweight HTML/JavaScript tool for quickly adding speech bubbles to images. It was created because I couldn’t find a fast, no-frills tool that didn’t require a full image editing suite just to add a few callouts.

Unlike heavy image editors, BubbleUp loads instantly, runs locally offline (or online with a webserver if you chose to), and provides an intuitive, focused UI for speech bubble editing.
