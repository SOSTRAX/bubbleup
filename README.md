BubbleUp is a quick html/javascript page that allows you to embed speechbubbles in images. I couldn't find anything like it which was fast. Yes there are many more image editors that can do this but I wanted something simple and fast loading.

You can just run this index file stand-alone in your preferred browser or you can create an .exe so it opens in an app-mode default browser without the toolbars. There are a few free tools to do that.

Here is the basis of it's functionality:
How to Use BubbleUp
1. Upload Image: Click 'Upload Image' to choose your base image.

2. Create Bubble: Click 'Create Speech Bubble' to open the editor. Enter text, choose styles, and click 'Save Changes'. A new bubble appears centered.

3. Move/Resize Bubbles: Drag the bubble body to reposition. Drag the small squares at the corners to resize. Drag the small square at the tail tip to adjust the tail.

4. Edit Bubble: Double-click an existing bubble to reopen its editor.

5. Pan: Drag the canvas background to pan around, especially when zoomed in.

6. Zoom: Use '+' and '-' buttons to zoom in/out, or 'Reset' to return to 100%.

7. Save: 'Save Edited Image' saves your work. Check 'Save within Original Image Bounds' to crop the output to the original image's dimensions.

8. Clear Canvas: Removes all images and bubbles.
